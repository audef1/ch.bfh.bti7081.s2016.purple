## Requirements document

#### Preface (Flo)
This should define the expected readership of the document and describe
its version history including a rationale for the creation of a new version
and a summary of the changes made in each version.

#### Introduction (Flo)
This should describe the need for the system. It should briefly describe the
systemâ€™s functions and explain how it will work with other systems . It
should also describe how the system fits into the overall business or
strategic objectives of the organization commissioning the software.

#### Glossary (alle)
This should define the technical terms used in the document. You should
not make assumptions about the experience or expertise of the reader.

#### User requirements definition (alle, remo und mathias detailliert)
Here, you describe the services provided for the user. The nonfunctional
system requirements should also be described in this section. This
description may use natural language diagrams, or other notations that are
understandable to customers. Product and process standards that must be
followed should be specified. (Use Case- and Activity Diagrams)

#### System Architecture (Tobias)
This chapter should present a high-level overview of the anticipated system
architecture, showing the distribution of functions across system modules.
Architectural components that are reused should be highlighted.

#### System requirements specification (Tobias)
This should describe the functional and nonfunctional requirements in more detail.
If necessary, further detail may also be added to the nonfunctional requirements.
Interfaces to other systems may be defined.

#### System models (nach Lust und Laune)
This might include graphical system models showing the relationships between
the system components and the system and its environment. Examples of
possible models are object models, data- flow models or semantic data models.

#### System evolution (Flo)
This should describe the fundamental assumptions on which the system is based,
and any anticipated changes due to hardware evolution, changing user needs,
and so on. This section is useful for system designers as it may help them avoid
design decisions that would constrain likely future changes to the system.

#### Testing (Raphael)
This chapter should contain an overview description of what and how you want to
test your system.

#### Appendices
These should provide detailed, specific information that is related to the
application being developed; for example, hardware and database descriptions.
Hardware requirements define the minimal and optimal configurations for the
system. Database requirements define the logical organization of the data used
by the system and the relationships between data.

#### Index
Several indexes to the document may be included. As well as a normal alphabetic
index, there may be an index of diagrams, an index of functions, and so on.
